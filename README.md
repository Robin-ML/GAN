## GAN
There are various forms of GAN implementations source code.

Some versions are newer and more polished, and I generally recommend using simpler implementations as a starting point if you are looking to experiment with the techniques, build upon it, or apply it to novel datasets.

Some of GAN include:
- BigGAN
- CGAN
- DCGAN
- GAN with Weight Normalization and ResNet
- WGAN
